This is a simple program that can be executed in the CLI to query the IPStack API and obtain the latitude and longitude of an IP address. In order to execute this program, make sure node is installed on your machine. You may then execute this in the terminal by navigating to the location of this file and running `node get_location.js <IP_ADDRESS>` and the program will return the latitude and logitude of the requested IP address. 

Security in this program can be improved by:
- API key protection. The API key should be protected to avoid accidental exposure.
- HTTPS protocol to ensure secure communication
